# Linear Algebra Laboratories

In the latter half of 2023, I completed a series of laboratories for the Linear Algebra course in Computer Engineering at KNTU University under the mentorship of Dr. Behrouz Nasihat Kon.

Moreover, during the first half of 2024, I am serving as a teaching assistant under the supervision of Dr. Mahsan Tavakoli. In this position, I will organize workshops for electrical engineering students.

Within this repository, you'll find a collection of lab exercises designed for the Linear Algebra course at KNTU University, led by Dr. Behrooz Nasihatkon.

These labs delve into fundamental concepts of linear algebra such as vectorization, span, basis, and linear combinations of vectors, among others. Implementation is carried out in Python, utilizing libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib.

Each lab comes with its own set of instructions, which are provided in PDF format in its manual.
